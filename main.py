The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a feedforward neural network

any continuous function on a compact subset of R^n to arbitrary accuracy, 
provided the activation function is non-constant, bounded, and monotonically 
increasing (such as sigmoid) or unbounded (such as ReLU).

Mathematical formulation:
For any continuous function f: K → R on a compact set K ⊆ R^n, and any ε > 0,
there exists a neural network F with one hidden layer such that:
    |F(x) - f(x)| < ε for all x ∈ K
