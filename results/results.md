## Task 1: Universal Approximation Theorem

### Execution Output

```
======================================================================
TASK 1: UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION THEOREM
======================================================================
📖 UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION THEOREM STATEMENT:
--------------------------------------------------
The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a feedforward neural network 
with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate 
any continuous function on a compact subset of R^n to arbitrary accuracy, 
provided the activation function is non-constant, bounded, and monotonically 
increasing (such as sigmoid) or unbounded (such as ReLU).
Mathematical formulation:
For any continuous function f: K → R on a compact set K ⊆ R^n, and any ε > 0,
there exists a neural network F with one hidden layer such that:
    |F(x) - f(x)| < ε for all x ∈ K
🚨 PRACTICAL ASPECTS THE THEOREM DOESN'T TELL US:
-------------------------------------------------------
   1. HOW MANY NEURONS ARE NEEDED: The theorem guarantees existence but doesn't specify the required...
   2. HOW TO FIND THE WEIGHTS: No algorithm is provided to find the optimal weights
   3. COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY: Training time and computational requirements are not addressed
   4. GENERALIZATION: Performance on unseen data is not guaranteed
   5. NUMERICAL STABILITY: Real-world implementation challenges are ignored
   6. OPTIMIZATION LANDSCAPE: The theorem doesn't address local minima or optimization difficulties
   7. SAMPLE COMPLEXITY: How much training data is needed is not specified
   8. APPROXIMATION vs LEARNING: Memorizing training data ≠ learning the underlying function
🔬 EMPIRICAL DEMONSTRATION:
-----------------------------------
Testing approximation of f(x) = sin(2πx) + 0.5*cos(4πx)
     5 neurons → R² = 0.0169
    10 neurons → R² = 0.0595
    25 neurons → R² = 0.0530
    50 neurons → R² = 0.0558
   100 neurons → R² = 0.0471
✅ Key Insight: More neurons generally improve approximation, but diminishing returns occur
   Best performance: 10 neurons (R² = 0.0595)
```

### Key Findings

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Universal Approximation Theorem guarantees function approximation capability
- Single hidden layer sufficient for continuous function approximation
- Practical implementation faces significant challenges

**Practical Limitations Identified:**
- Network size requirements not specified by theorem
- Optimization landscape complexity not addressed
- Generalization performance not guaranteed
- Training data requirements unclear

**Empirical Validation:**

- Performance improvement with increased network size
- Diminishing returns observed beyond optimal size

**Best Performance:** 10 neurons (R² = 0.0595)
